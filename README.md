# TestPortfolio

Hello, here I am creating my portfolio to show my testing skills.

I will be testing Steam website, which is https://store.steampowered.com/

Used tools: Lightshot, TestLink, Git/Github,

# Info

1. Test suites are placed in 'Tests' directory

2. Every test suite contains test cases

3. Abbreviations:

	a. STP - Steam Test Plan

	b. ATT - Attachment (optionally ATT-1 - Attachment no. 1)
	
	c. TL - TestLink (screenshot)

4. Every test case name contains prefix and ordinal number, e.g. STP-1, STP-5

5. Every test case directory contains screenshot from TestLink, which is named with 'TL' at the end, e.g. STP-1-TL, STP-5-TL and optionally attachments, named with 'ATT' at the end, e.g. STP-1-ATT, STP-5-ATT

# TestPortfolio

Hello, here I am creating my portfolio to show my testing skills.

I will be testing Steam website, which is https://store.steampowered.com/


# Info

1. Test cases are placed here as screenshot from TestLink
1.1 Every test case contains prefix and ordinal number, e.g. STP-1, STP-5
1.2 Every test case directory contains screenshot from TestLink, which is named with 'TL' at the end, e.g. STP-1-TL, STP-5-TL. Optionally there are test case attachments, named with 'ATT' at the end, e.g. STP-1-ATT, STP-5-ATT
